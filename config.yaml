# BUSCO lineage
# The assesed lineage is automatically chosen by BUSCO.
# If you want to use specified lineage you can change this parameter
# by specifying the lineage.
# For example:
# lineage: "eudicots_odb10"
# You can list all possible lineages by running "busco --list-datasets"
lineage: "eudicots_odb10"

# CD-HIT option
# By default the pipeline doesn't cluster identical sequences
# If you would like to cluster 100% identical sequences then set this parameter to "true"
# If set to true the pipeline will run CD-HIT with these parameters: cd-hit -i {input} -o {output} -c 1.00 -n 5 -g 1 -d 0 &>> {log}
cd-hit: "false" 

# NOTE: if you set CD-HIT to true you can also add clusters.tsv to the list of files in rule all in Snakefile
# by adding it the pipeline will generate a tsv file with the information about the clusters CD-HIT generated
